Hi! I'm Wayne Chang, and I can help you figure out what software _not_ to build
and then build only the things that matter.

I've taken companies with zero technology and helped them grow them into
profitable product lines consisting of modern web and native mobile
applications. I've planned and executed robust solutions for clients who have
complex security requirements and big existing infrastructures.

For us to be successful together, our most important focus should be a mutual
understanding about what's truly valuable to your business; everything else is
likely noise. Bringing this understanding to every level of our decision-making
will ensure that working together will be completely worthwhile.

#### Nice words by even nicer people:
