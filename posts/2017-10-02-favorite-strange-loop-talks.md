It was a great conference.

Here's a list (in no particular order) of some of the most interesting talks:

- ["Haxl: A Big Hammer for Concurrency" by Simon Marlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT6VJkkhy0o&list=PLcGKfGEEONaDzd0Hkn2f1talsTu1HLDYu&index=2):
  There is a beautiful passage of cluster management code from which this
  presentation is based. Seeing that code itself is already worth clicking!

- ["Dependent Types in Haskell" by Stephanie Weirich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNa3MMbhwS4&index=32&list=PLcGKfGEEONaDzd0Hkn2f1talsTu1HLDYu):
  She gives a very practical example that is encountered day-to-day for most
  programmers, and details how dependent types can make the code better.
  Near the end, there's even an inductive proof snuck into the type system to
  ensure certain properties.

- ["Just-So Stories for AI: Explaining Black-Box Predictions" by Sam
  Ritchie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiWkKqZChF0&index=22&list=PLcGKfGEEONaDzd0Hkn2f1talsTu1HLDYu):
  Sam Ritchie is an excellent presenter, and I think he does a great job
  setting up motivation before diving into technical details

- ["Leveraging DSLs (Almost) for Free" by Alvin Cheung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shDoux5Dcyk&list=PLcGKfGEEONaDzd0Hkn2f1talsTu1HLDYu&index=25):
  Alvin Cheung talks about refactoring and translating programming languages
  automatically. His example automatically rewrites naive Java code to run on
  an Apache Spark cluster, resulting in impressive performance gains rivaling
  "hand-rolled" Spark-specific code.

- ["Strength in Numbers: Unums and the Quest for Reliable Arithmetic" by Ferris Ellis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVNYjmj_qbY&index=33&list=PLcGKfGEEONaDzd0Hkn2f1talsTu1HLDYu):
  Ferris Ellis suggests we all stop lying to ourselves that floating point
  numbers are precise. Instead, uncertainty should be baked into the data
  structure for some more honest arithmetic.

- ["A (Not So Gentle) Introduction To Systems Programming In ATS" by Aditya Siram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt0OQb1DBko&list=PLcGKfGEEONaDzd0Hkn2f1talsTu1HLDYu&index=13):
  Aditya Siram makes C safer without forcing us to arrest our pointers.


I'm almost certain there were other amazing talks not on my personal list, but
my schedule simply did not permit.
