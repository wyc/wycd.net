Time ownership is a curious way to view relationships between machines and
people, and among their own groups as well. When I ask the compiler to produce
my program, am I a servant to it as I wait? What about heating up something in
the microwave for 30 seconds? Most annoying are events too short in duration to
defer checking of results, yet long enough to interrupt user concentration and
flow.
