It's 2030, and you're an entrepreneur raising the very first round of funding
for your new venture. The pitch you gave today went really well, and now you're
discussing terms with a very interested investor. You both agreed on some
numbers and timelines, and now it's time to wrap up.

In the very early 2000s, this would have involved signing a meatspace paper
contract and setting up your bank wire. Now, everyone simply uses ANGEL
contracts on the blockchain. They were the logical next step after early
organizations like [S3 Ventures](http://www.s3vc.com/resources/s3-venture-cap-table-template/)
began standardizing fundraising processes and when the supporting technologies
matured.

ANGEL contracts evolved from the _convertible note_, a kind of "I Owe You" that
can be converted into ownership of a borrowing company some time in the
future. Convertible notes helped companies raise money with just a team, an
idea, and a prototype; it didn't require agreement on a company's market
valuation before investment, which is problematic to ascertain so early.

Like a convertible note, the ANGEL contract takes several parameters, including
discount rate, valuation cap, interest rate, and maturity date. However,
instead of writing these into a spreadsheet or paper document, they're inputted
into the ANGEL mobile application.

### Signing

You watch the investor populate values in the collaborative contract view on
your mobile device. Once it's completed, you both activate the lock icons on
your displays, which must both be then unlocked for any further edits to the
draft. Because both views are locked, the investor can now fire off the
contract with a specifiable acceptance window, 48 hours by default. If both of
your digital signatures are received within that period, then the contract
begins. Otherwise, nothing happens.

At this point, you contact your friends and mentors for advice on your
decision. For a reasonable fee, anyone can access an official and certified
ANGEL contract specialist to review their understanding of the terms in any
language. They are able to leverage anonymized market averages in their advice.
Their credentials and contract volumes are immediately verifiable on the
blockchain, but no one will know if they helped with any particular contract.

48 hours later, both of you have already signed the agreement with your digital
private keys. A processing fee is collected from the investor's account--about
the price of a good coffee. The funds are escrowed into an interest-accruing
account for release upon the contract's specified `beginDateTime` parameter.
Follow-up messages asking for transfer timelines are a thing of the past.

### Review

To view the contract, you need the contract identifier and a participating
private key to sign a viewing request. Depending on contract settings, these
requests may be logged or not. This is rarely done except during litigation.
These days, everyone has an account with a document store provider, which
stores and organizes all their contracts and transactions in real time through
integrations with thousands of protocols.

The backoffice work that used to cost each party half a working day now happens
in five minutes. Hours spent with expensive lawyers are reduced to under an
hour with a contract specialist--the usefulness of a standard and
well-understood instrument really shines. The investor now has more time and
mental capacity to focus on picking good investments, and the entrepreneur can
spend extra effort on their pitch decks and product.

### Introspection

Here are some analyses on different aspects of this scenario, and how it
relates to cryptocurrencies and processes today.

#### New Benefits

- **Labor-saving**. Less thinking with more automated standards. Trust the
  contract, not the billing department.
- **New specializations and jobs**, including contract specialist, contract
  network manager, blockchain performance engineer, digital contract organizer,
  digital contract portfolio manager.
- **Global contracts for free**, contingent on a global blockchain-based equity
  solution. The contract terms are in code, and logic transcends language
  barriers. Programmatic enforcement does not care about nationality or credit.
- **Low lock-in and data transferability**. A new offering can come along and
  immediately import all your data with proper authorization, as the data formats
  and encrypted blobs will be publicly available. It could simply be a matter of
  importing a root contract key to move a whole corpus to a new service.

#### Cryptocurrency Features Used

- **Currency-integrated logic** (currently known as **smart contracts**) allows
  for seamless integration between arbitration logic and transfers of value. At
  the time of writing, an implementation of this product would consist of a
  multi-party integration: banks from all parties for transfer, an escrow
  entity, and an arbitrator, and a product company. With enough advancements,
  all but the product company will be commoditized by blockchain automation.
  Without doubt, courts will still exist.
- **Public blockchains** ensure the global and available nature of this
  service. Contracts are fully auditable and directly driven by their code, not
  legislation. They also allow any authorized entity to immediately access
  versions of the contract for review without going through an intermediary.
- **Zero-knowledge proofs** would allow investors to stake claims on equity
  without revealing the details of their investments.
- **Multi-sig** is used to have more than a single participant in a
  transaction. For example, a firm's Limited Partner can be required as a
  signatory on all contracts.

#### Why a Centralized Solution May Not Be Enough

The biggest point is that a public network hosts and executes these contracts
instead of a centralized entity such as a digital contract company:

- **Digital contract companies can be compromised or become bankrupt**. With a
  public contract-executing blockchain as a base, this is far less of a
  concern.
- **Digital contract companies must be trusted**. Even if they make their
  contracts open-source, there would be no way of verifying that the contracts
  behave correctly short of having access to their private servers.  Audits of
  these contract companies may happen once every few months by auditing
  companies. Audits of public blockchain applications can happen at anytime by
  anyone.
- **Digital contract companies are not global**. In the U.S., they're
  even further bound to state laws. Having a registered corporate entity at all
  brings with it legal baggage. If it's just code running on a global network
  of nodes, then the whole network must be toppled to stop it.

#### Disadvantages

- **If you make an error, then you're still bound to it**. Adding an extra 0 by
  accident will be a very expensive mistake unless there is a robust contract
  amendment system. This is even more true for vulnerabilities found in the
  core contract code. Courts may be able to settle this off the blockchain, but
  they will need to evolve to arbitrate fairly in this new ecosystem.

#### Barriers to Entry Today

- **Cryptocurrencies are currently too volatile in price**, and therefore
  cannot be confidently used to pay for salaries, rentals, or equipment unless
  fixed to a more stable currency.
- **Regulation**. It's completely possible that courts rule that these
  contracts must to adhere to federal and municipal laws, or even that
  blockchain contracts are flat out illegal. However, is the location of
  signing for a global-blockchain contract even relevant? There's a lot of
  precedent that needs to be determined here.
