      <h2>Consulting</h2>
      <p>
<p>I’m currently available for new consulting engagements. If you think that I could help you grow your business, I’d love to chat. I have taken companies with zero technology and grown them into profitable product lines consisting of modern web and native mobile applications. I’ve worked on projects with complex security requirements and extensive ties to existing infrastructure.</p>
My most important focus is alignment on what is truly valuable to the business; everything else is likely noise. By incorporating this knowledge into every facet of my decision making, our outcome is likely to be a cost-effective home run. I work best with companies interested in <i>new product development</i>, <i>business technology that drives sales</i>, and <i>secure reliable applications</i>.
</p>
<p>
If this is you, then you can send me an email at <a href="mailto:wayne@wycd.net">wayne@wycd.net</a> with who you are and how I might be able to make your life easier.
</p>
