      <p>
<p>Hi! I’m Wayne Chang, and I can help you figure out what software <em>not</em> to build and then build whatever’s left.</p>
<p>I’ve taken companies with rough ideas and helped them grow them into profitable product lines consisting of modern web and native mobile applications. I’ve planned and executed nimble solutions for clients who have complex security requirements and complicated existing infrastructures.</p>
<p>For us to be successful together, our most important focus should be alignment on what’s truly valuable to your business; everything else is likely noise. Bringing this understanding to every level of our decision-making will ensure that we hit a home run.</p>

<p><strong>“</strong> Wayne architected a secure and scalable product that has successfully served tens of thousands of patients. He actively incorporates our business goals into technical decision-making and has developed large-scale automations that measurably improve productivity. Under Wayne’s technology leadership, we were able to swiftly win and support several new revenue-generating contracts.”</p>
<p><b>Benjamin Jack, M.D.</b><br /> Chief Executive Officer, Concierge/Stat</p>
