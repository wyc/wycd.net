title: Now

This is my [now](https://sivers.org/nowff) page. I expect that it will go out of date more often than I'd like, but with that in mind, maybe I'll be able to correct for it.

I recently moved to Atlanta, GA, and I'm starting to get a feel for the area. If you're around and think we should meet, let me know at <wayne@wycd.net>!

Currently, I am:

- looking for more [clients with interesting problems](/consulting.html)
- focused on writing more [blog posts](/blog.html)
- messing around with [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- thinking and [reading](http://amzn.to/2j1PVjN) [books](http://amzn.to/2jFLHjr) [about](http://amzn.to/2jNOd9t) [networks](http://amzn.to/2jFJVPB) of people

Today is January 22, 2017.
